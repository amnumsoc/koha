<h1>Circulation and Fines Rules</h1>

<p>These rules define how your items are circulated, how/when fines are calculated and how holds are handled. The rules are applied from most specific to less specific, using the first found in this order: </p>

<ul>
<li>same library, same patron type, same item type</li>
<li>same library, same patron type, default item type</li>
<li>same library, default patron type, same item type</li>
<li>same library, default patron type, default item type</li>
<li>default library, same patron type, same item type</li>
<li>default library, same patron type, default item type</li>
<li>default library, default patron type, same item type</li>
<li>default library, default patron type, default item type</li></ul>

<p><span style="background-color: #ffe599">TIP: If you are a single library system, you can leave your library selection to 'default library' or choose your branch name and experience the same results.</span></p>

<h3 class="section">Default Issuing Rule</h3>

<p>Using the issuing rules matrix you can define rules that depend on patron/item type combos. To set your rules, choose a library from the pull down: </p>
 
<p><span style="background-color: #ffe599">TIP: If you leave this set to 'Default' it will apply the rules to all libraries</span></p>

<p>From the matrix you can choose any combination of patron categories and item types to apply the rules to. </p>

<ul><li>First choose which patron category you'd like the rule to   be applied to. If you leave this to 'Default' it will apply to   all patron categories</li>
<li>Choose the 'Item Type' you would like this rule to apply   to. If you leave this to 'Default' it will apply to all item   types</li>
<li>Limit the number of items a patron can have checked out at   the same time by entering a number in the 'Current Checkouts   Allowed' field</li>
<li>Define the period of time and item can be checked out to a   patron by entering the number of days in the 'Loan Period'   box.</li>
<li>'Fine Amount' should have the amount you would like to   charge for overdue items
<ul><li><span style="color: #ff0000">IMPORTANT: Enter only numbers and decimal points.</span></li></ul></li>
<li>The 'Fine Grace Period' is the period of time an item can   be overdue before you start charging fines.</li>
<li>Enter the 'Fine Charging Interval' in days (ex. charge   fines every 1 day, or every 2 days)</li>
<li>If your library 'fines' patrons by suspending their   account you can enter the number of days their fine should be   suspended in the 'Suspension in Days' field</li>
<li>Next decide if the patron can renew this item type and if   so, enter how many times they can renew it in the 'Renewals   Allowed' box</li>
<li>If the patron can place holds on this item type, enter the   total numbers of items (of this type) that can be put on hold in   the 'Holds Allowed' field</li>
<li>Finally, if you charge a rental fee for the item type and   want to give a specific patron type a discount on that fee,   enter the percentage discount (without the % symbol) in the   'Rental Discount' field</li></ul>

<p>When finished, click 'Add' to save your changes. To modify a rule, create a new one with the same patron type and item type. If you would like to delete your rule, simply click the 'Delete' link to the right of the rule. </p>

<p>To save time you can clone rules from one library to another by choosing the clone option above the rules matrix. </p>

<p>After choosing to clone you will be presented with a confirmation message. </p>

<h3 class="section">Default Checkouts and Hold Policy</h3>

<p>You can set a default maximum number of checkouts and hold policy that will be used if none is defined below for a particular item type or category. </p>

<p>From this menu you can set a default to apply to all item types and patrons in the library. </p>

<ul><li>In 'Total Current Checkouts Allowed' enter the total   number of items patrons can have checked out at one time</li>
<li>Control where patrons can place holds from using the 'Hold   Policy' menu
<ul><li>From Any Library: Patrons from any library may put this item on hold. (default if none is defined)</li>
<li>From Home Library: Only patrons from the item's home library may put this book on hold.</li>
<li>No Holds Allowed: No patron may put this book on hold.</li></ul></li>
<li>Once your policy is set, you can unset it by clicking the   'Unset' link to the right of the rule</li></ul>

<h3 class="section">Checkouts Per Patron</h3>

<p>For this library, you can specify the maximum number of loans that a patron of a given category can make, regardless of the item type. </p>
 
<p><span style="background-color: #ffe599">TIP: If the total amount loanable for a given patron category is left blank, no limit applies, except possibly for a limit you define for a specific item type.</span></p>

<h3 class="section">Item Hold Policies</h3>

<p>For this library, you can edit rules for given itemtypes, regardless of the patron's category. Currently, this means hold policies. </p>
 
<p>The various policies have the following effects: </p>

<ul><li>From Any Library: Patrons from any library may put this   item on hold. (default if none is defined)</li>
<li>From Home Library: Only patrons from the item's home   library may put this book on hold.</li>
<li>No Holds Allowed: No patron may put this book on   hold.</li></ul> 
 
<p><span style="color: #ff0000">IMPORTANT: Note that if the system preference AllowHoldPolicyOverride set to 'allow', these policies can be overridden by your circulation staff.</span></p>
 
<p><span style="color: #ff0000">IMPORTANT: These policies are based on the patron's home branch, not the branch that the reserving staff member is from.</span> </p>
